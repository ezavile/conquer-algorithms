### Divide and conquer (D&C)

It's a well-known recursive technique for solving problems. D&C isn't a simple algorithm that you can apply to a problem, **it's a way to think about a problem**.

To solve a problem using D&C, there are two steps:

1. Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.

> TIP: When you're writing a recursive function involving an array, the base case is often an empty array or an array with one element.
